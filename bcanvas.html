            Technically you do not need appliances in order to make the butter but in order save your arms and make the process quick and easy we will be using them for this project. If you would like to learn how to make butter by hand without using an appliance at all you can click here. For now let's get on with the business of making this delicious fresh butter. Below we have included a short list of items you will want to have on hand to complete this project but this list is in no way exhaustive.

                <h3>Gather Supplies</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Half Gallon of Milk</li>
                        <li>2 Tablespoons of Salt</li>
                        <li>Container With Lid</li>
                        <li>Spatula</li>
                        <li>Stand Mixer or Hand Mixer</li>
                        <li>Measuring Cup</li>
                        <li>**If you are using a hand mixer you will also need a large bowl in which to process your butter**</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Get Started</h3>
                <p>
                    First measure out 3 cups of milk and pour it into your mixing bowl. Next begin running your mixer with just the milk inside. Now if you are using a standmixer you can allow this to run for several minutes but do not walk away from your butter as the stages can go quickly once they begin. If you are using a handmixer you can hold it just in the middle of the bowl until the butter starts to thicken. Once this happens you will need to make sure you are moving the mixer around in a circular motion to make sure the process is progressing evenly.

                <p>
                    After your butter thickens it will soon move into a clumpy stage. It will kind of look like curds and whey. This is when the magic happens. Allow the mixer to keep running until the curd like pieces start to clump together into a larger mass. Now you have a couple of options. One is to pour off this liquid into a container and save it because --CONGRATULATIONS, You Just Made ButterMilk!!! The other option is to just toss it out.

                <p>
                    Now we are in home stretch. You can run through the same process of remixing the butter if you would like to remove more of the liquid. If you would like to have salted butter you can add salt to the second round before mixing.

                <h3>Keeping Your Butter Fresh</h3>
                <p>
                    The easy way to keep your fresh butter fresh is just to place it in a container with a lid and pop it in the fridge. You can also try out some of the specialty containers made to keep butter fresh right on your countertop so it stays soft and spreadable.

                <h3>Mixing It Up</h3>
                <p>
                    You can add just about anything to your butter but as far as how it will taste. That is another matter altogether. Generally there are two main camps for flavoring your butter. Sweet or Savory.

                <ul>
                    <li>Some Savory Options:</li>
                    <li>Garlic and Chive</li>
                    <li>Bacon Parmesan</li>
                    <li>Italian Spice Blend</li>

                    This list is by no means exhaustive. You can have lots of fun trying different additives on toast or crackers. You could even make a fun little party novelty of it with some friends or family. Just have fun finding your own recipes and Enjoy!
